title: "Collaborative Analytics Workshop"
---

Welcome to the Collaborative Analytics Workshop! This workshop is designed to help you explore different tools and resources for conducting a range of common epidemiological analytical tasks. Our primary goal is for you to take home a functional script that generates an interactive epidemiological situation report that you can build on and adapt for your own work moving forward.

## Workshop Structure

You will be grouped by the analytical tasks you are interested in and work through them together with support from the facilitators. Depending on your technical level, you may complete multiple tasks over different sessions and therefore change groups.

By the end of Day 1, you should have:

- Completed the [Setup](setup.qmd) section (installing R, RStudio, packages and setting up the correct folder structure)
- Imported your own data or the example dataset from the [Data](data.qmd) section
- Completed [Task 1](task1.qmd), which generates a basic descriptive situation report

By the end of Day 2, you should have:

- Completed one or more of the other analytical tasks (Tasks 2-9)
- Incorporated your chosen analytical tasks into your example report
- A functional script that generates an interactive epidemiological situation report ready to adapt for your own work

## Tasks

Each task page includes:

- Links to external tutorials that provide comprehensive learning materials and detailed explanations of the analytical concepts and methods.
- Complete example code that generates all the outputs needed for an example report. The example code works with the provided example datasets

You can work with your own data throughout the workshop or you can use the example datasets provided. If you don't have your own dataset or don't feel comfortable adapting code to your data, you can use the example datasets and example code. This will still allow you to learn the analytical techniques and generate a functional report you can reference later.

## Getting Started

1. Visit the [Setup](setup.qmd) page for installation instructions and required packages
2. Download the example datasets from the [Data](data.qmd) section
3. Navigate to the Tasks menu to find the analytical tasks you're interested in
4. Join your group to work through the materials with support from facilitators.
