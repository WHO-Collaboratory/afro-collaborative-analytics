title: "Collaborative Analytics Workshop"
---

Welcome to the Collaborative Analytics Workshop! This workshop is designed to help you explore different tools and resources for conducting a range of common epidemiological analytical tasks. Our primary goal is for you to take home a functional script that generates an interactive epidemiological situation report that you can build on and adapt for your own work moving forward.

### Workshop Agenda

This is a single-day workshop running from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM. You will be grouped by the datasets you are working on to facilitate collaboration and peer support. Throughout the day, facilitators will be available to provide guidance and answer questions. 

In the first half of the day, you will work on rendering your first automated situation report. In the second half of the day, you will work through one or two more advanced analytical tasks based on your interests and needs. The day will be structured as follows:

| Time | Duration | Activity |
|----|----|----------|
| 9:00 - 9:30 | 30 min | Welcome, introduction, divide into groups |
| 9:30 - 10:30 | 60 min | Complete [Setup](setup.qmd) and [Data](data.qmd) sections |
| 10:30 - 11:00 | 30 min | Morning tea |
| 11:00 - 12:00 | 60 min | Complete [Task 1](task1.qmd): Generating a basic situation report sections |
| 12:00 - 12:30 | 30 min | Regroup and discuss progress |
| 12:30 - 13:30 | 60 min | Lunch break |
| 13:30 - 15:00 | 90 min | Complete first advanced task |
| 15:00 - 15:30 | 30 min | Afternoon break |
| 15:30 - 17:00 | 90 min | Complete second advanced task |

### Tasks

The analytical tasks you can choose from are:

1. [Generating a basic situation report](task1.qmd)
2. [Generating interactive maps](task2.qmd)
3. [Visualising transmission chains](task3.qmd)
4. [Getting epidemiological parameters](task4.qmd)
5. [Estimating disease severity](task5.qmd)
6. [Estimating the reproduction number](task6.qmd)
7. [Nowcasting epidemiological data](task7.qmd)
8. [Forecasting cases and deaths](task8.qmd)
9. [Simulating disease transmission](task9.qmd)

Each task page includes:

- Links to external tutorials that provide comprehensive learning materials and detailed explanations of the analytical concepts and methods.
- Complete example code that generates all the outputs needed for an example report. The example code works with the provided example datasets

You can work with your own data throughout the workshop or you can use the example datasets provided. If you don't have your own dataset or don't feel comfortable adapting code to your data, you can use the example datasets and example code. This will still allow you to learn the analytical techniques and generate a functional report you can reference later.

### Getting Started

1. Visit the [Setup](setup.qmd) page for installation instructions and required packages
2. Download the example datasets from the [Data](data.qmd) section
3. Navigate to the Tasks menu to find the analytical tasks you're interested in
4. Join your group to work through the materials with support from facilitators.
