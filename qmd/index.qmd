title: "Collaborative Analytics Hackathon"
---

## Aim

There are two core aims of the hackathon we would like you to achieve:

1. **Explore different tools and resources** for conducting a range of common analytical tasks.

2. **Write a functional script** that applies one or more analyses to their own data and generates a report or dashboard to visualise the outputs.

## Structure

You will be grouped by the analytical tasks you are interested in and work through them together with support from the facilitators. During these sessions, you will apply the analyses to your own data and incorporate the analysis into your final report/dashboard script. Depending on your technical level, you may complete multiple tasks over different sessions and therefore change groups.

## Tasks

The analytical tasks you can choose from are:

1. [Reading and cleaning data](task1.qmd)
2. [Generating automated situation reports](task2.qmd)
3. [Making an interactive dashboard](task3.qmd)
4. [Visualising transmission chains](task4.qmd)
5. [Getting epidemiological parameters](task5.qmd)
6. [Estimating the reproduction number](task6.qmd)
7. [Nowcasting epidemiological data](task7.qmd)
8. [Forecasting cases and deaths](task8.qmd)
9. [Estimating disease severity](task9.qmd)
10. [Simulating disease transmission](task10.qmd)

Each task has its own dedicated page with resources and guidance. Click on any task above to explore it.

## Getting Started

1. **Install R and RStudio**: Visit the [Setup](setup.qmd) page for installation instructions and required packages.

2. **Download example datasets**: Visit the [Data](data.qmd) section to download the datasets you'll need.

3. **Explore tasks**: Navigate to the **Tasks** menu to find the analytical task(s) you're interested in.

4. **Join your group**: Work through the materials with support from facilitators.

## Additional Resources

- **Recommended refresher** on basic R literacy by [AppliedEpi](https://appliedepi.org/resources/tutorials.html)
