## Installing R and RStudio

To get started, you'll need to install R and RStudio on your computer. 

**For installation instructions and downloads, please visit**: [Epiverse-TRACE Software Setup](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/tutorials-early/index.html#software-setup). This guide will assist you with installing R and RStudio, including checking your R version and updating if needed.

### Unable to install locally?

If you're unable to install R and RStudio on your laptop, you can use **[Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud/plans)** instead: this provide a free cloud-based RStudio environment that you can access from any web browser.

## Installing R Packages

Before setting up your project, you'll need to install some essential R packages. We'll use **pacman**, a package management tool for R that simplifies installing and loading packages. Pacman automatically installs packages if they're not already installed, then loads them - making it much easier to manage dependencies.

Run the following code in your R console to install pacman (if needed) and then install the essential packages:

```r
# Install pacman if needed
if (!requireNamespace("pacman", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("pacman")
}

# Install essential packages using pacman
pacman::p_load(
  tidyverse,  # For data manipulation and visualization
  rmarkdown   # For creating reports (required for Quarto)
)
```

**Note:** Additional packages will be installed as you work through specific tasks. For now, these two packages are sufficient to get started.

## Setting Up Your Project

Before you begin working on the tasks, let's set up your RStudio project and folder structure.

### Step 1: Create an RStudio R Project

An **R Project** is a way to organize your work in RStudio. It helps keep all your files, data, and outputs together in one place, and automatically sets your working directory so file paths work correctly.

1. Open RStudio.
2. Go to **File → New Project**.
3. Select **New Directory**.
4. Select **New Project**.
5. In the "Directory name" field, enter `sitrep`.
6. Choose a location on your computer where you want to save the project.
7. Click **Create Project**.

RStudio will now open your new project. You'll see the project name (`sitrep`) in the top-right corner of RStudio.

### Step 2: Set Up Your Folder Structure

Within your project, create the following subfolders to organize your files:

1. In RStudio, click the **Files** tab in the bottom-right pane.
2. Click **New Folder**.
3. Create a folder called `data/` - for storing your datasets.
4. Create a folder called `outputs/` - for storing generated reports and figures.
4. Create a folder called `scripts/` - for storing your R scripts.

## Download Cleaned Dataset

This is an example dataset resembling a fictional Ebola outbreak that will be used in the various examples throughout the workshop tasks. The dataset is from the [Applied Epi R Handbook](https://www.epirhandbook.com/) and contains a cleaned case linelist with epidemiological data including case demographics, dates, locations, and outcomes.

After downloading, place the file in your `data/` folder. The example code in each analysis task is already set up to work with this dataset structure.

## Setting Up Your Quarto Document

Now let's create a basic Quarto document that you'll use for your epidemiological reports.

### Step 1: Create a New Quarto Document

1. In RStudio, go to **File → New File → Quarto Document**.
2. Choose **HTML** as the output format.
3. Give your document a title (e.g., "Epidemiological Situation Report").
4. Click **Create**.
5. **Save the document** in your project folder (e.g., `sitrep.qmd`).

#### Understanding Visual and Source Editing Modes

When you open your Quarto document, you'll notice two editing mode buttons in the top-left corner of the editor: **Visual** and **Source**.

- **Visual mode**: Provides a "What You See Is What You Get" editing experience, similar to a word processor. You can format text using buttons and menus, and see a preview of how your document will look.

- **Source mode**: Shows the raw Markdown and code syntax. You work directly with the text, code chunks, and formatting syntax (like `##` for headings, `**bold**` for bold text, etc.).

**For the rest of this tutorial and the task tutorials, we'll assume you're using Source mode.** This allows you to directly copy and paste code chunks and content from the tutorials into your document. You can switch between modes at any time using the buttons in the top-left corner - just click **Source** to switch to source mode.

### Step 2: Set Up the YAML Header and Report Structure

At the top of your Quarto document, you'll see a **YAML header** (the section between the `---` lines). The YAML header contains metadata about your document, such as the title and output format. It tells Quarto how to render your document.

Ensure your YAML header looks like this:

```yaml
---
title: "Epidemiological Situation Report"
format: html
editor: visual
---
```

Below the YAML header, create a basic report structure with sections. In Quarto (and Markdown), you use `##` to create section headings (level 2 headings). Each `##` creates a new major section in your report. You can use `###` for subsections, `####` for sub-subsections, and so on.

Add this basic outline to your document:

```markdown
## Overview

This section will provide an introduction and overview of the situation report.

## Epidemiological Trends

This section will describe epidemiological trends.

## Severity

This section will conduct a severity analysis.

## Conclusions

This section will summarize findings and next steps.
```

#### Understanding Code Chunks

A **code chunk** is a section in your Quarto document where you write and execute R code. Code chunks are enclosed between three backticks (`` ``` ``) followed by `{r}` and closed with three more backticks.

To create a code chunk:

1. Type three backticks followed by `{r}` on a new line: ` ```{r} `
2. Press Enter to start a new line
3. Write your R code
4. Type three backticks on a new line to close the chunk: ` ``` `

Here's what a code chunk looks like:

<pre><code>```{r}
# Your R code goes here
library(tidyverse)
```</code></pre>

You can also insert a code chunk in RStudio by:

- Clicking the **Insert** button (green plus icon with a "C") in the toolbar, or
- Using the keyboard shortcut: `Ctrl+Alt+I` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Option+I` (Mac)

Code chunks allow you to run R code, create plots, generate tables, and perform data analysis. The results (outputs, plots, tables) will appear in your rendered HTML report.

### Step 3: Install and Load Basic Packages

In the first code chunk of your document, install and load the basic packages needed for report generation. We'll use **pacman**, a package management tool for R that simplifies installing and loading packages. Pacman automatically installs packages if they're not already installed, then loads them - making it much easier to manage dependencies.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true

# Install pacman if needed
if (!requireNamespace("pacman", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("pacman")
}

# Install and load required packages using pacman
pacman::p_load(
  tidyverse,  # For data manipulation and visualization
  rio,        # For importing data
  reactable   # For interactive tables
)
```

**Note:** We'll add more packages as needed when you work through specific tasks. Additional packages will be installed as you progress through the tutorials.

### Step 4: Render Your Report

Now let's test that everything is working by rendering your report:

1. Click the **Render** button in RStudio (or press `Ctrl+Shift+K` / `Cmd+Shift+K`).
2. Quarto will process your document and generate an HTML file.
3. The HTML report will open automatically in your browser.

You should now see a basic HTML report with your title and section headings. This confirms that your Quarto setup is working correctly!

If you prefer, you can download the example sitrep template directly instead of creating it yourself:
