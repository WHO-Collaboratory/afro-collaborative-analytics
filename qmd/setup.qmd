## Installing R and RStudio

To get started, you'll need to install R and RStudio on your computer. 

**For installation instructions and downloads, please visit**: [Epiverse-TRACE Software Setup](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/tutorials-early/index.html#software-setup). This guide will assist you with installing R and RStudio, including checking your R version and updating if needed.

### Unable to install locally?

If you're unable to install R and RStudio on your laptop, you can use **[Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud/plans)** instead: this provide a free cloud-based RStudio environment that you can access from any web browser.

## Installing R Packages

Before setting up your project, you'll need to install some essential R packages. We'll use **pacman**, a package management tool for R that simplifies installing and loading packages. Pacman automatically installs packages if they're not already installed, then loads them - making it much easier to manage dependencies.

Run the following code in your R console to install pacman (if needed) and then install the essential packages:

```r
# Install pacman if needed
if (!requireNamespace("pacman", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("pacman")
}

# Install essential packages using pacman
pacman::p_load(
  tidyverse,  # For data manipulation and visualization
  rmarkdown   # For creating reports (required for Quarto)
)
```

**Note:** Additional packages will be installed as you work through specific tasks. For now, these two packages are sufficient to get started.

## Setting Up Your Project

Before you begin working on the tasks, let's set up your RStudio project and folder structure.

### Step 1: Create an RStudio R Project

An **R Project** is a way to organize your work in RStudio. It helps keep all your files, data, and outputs together in one place, and automatically sets your working directory so file paths work correctly.

1. Open RStudio.
2. Go to **File → New Project**.
3. Select **New Directory**.
4. Select **New Project**.
5. In the "Directory name" field, enter `sitrep`.
6. Choose a location on your computer where you want to save the project.
7. Click **Create Project**.

RStudio will now open your new project. You'll see the project name (`sitrep`) in the top-right corner of RStudio.

### Step 2: Set Up Your Folder Structure

Within your project, create the following subfolders to organize your files:

1. In RStudio, click the **Files** tab in the bottom-right pane.
2. Click **New Folder**.
3. Create a folder called `data/` - for storing your datasets.
4. Create a folder called `outputs/` - for storing generated reports and figures.
4. Create a folder called `scripts/` - for storing your R scripts.

## Download Cleaned Dataset

This is an example dataset resembling a fictional Ebola outbreak that will be used in the various examples throughout the workshop tasks. The dataset is from the [Applied Epi R Handbook](https://www.epirhandbook.com/) and contains a cleaned case linelist with epidemiological data including case demographics, dates, locations, and outcomes.

After downloading, place the file in your `data/` folder. The example code in each analysis task is already set up to work with this dataset structure.

## Next Steps

Once you have the basics set up:

1. If you want a refresher on the basics of R, visit the [Intro to R](intro.qmd) section.
2. If you are interested in the basics of data wrangling, visit the data [importing](data_import.qmd) or [cleaning](data_clean.qmd) pages.
2. If you are interested in analytics, explore the analysis tab to find the tasks you're interested in.
