Download the example datasets below to get started with the hackathon tasks. These datasets are from the [Applied Epi R Handbook](https://www.epirhandbook.com/) and can be used for practice and testing your analytical scripts. They resemble a fictional Ebola outbreak. 

## Raw case linelist

The raw case linelist is an Excel spreadsheet with messy data. Use this when tackling [Task 1](task1.qmd), which goes over the basics of cleaning data.
