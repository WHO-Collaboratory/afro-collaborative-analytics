title: "Importing data from HIS"
---

## Overview

Many epidemiological datasets are stored in health information systems (HIS) such as DHIS2 or SORMAS. These systems provide application program interfaces (APIs) that allow verified users to import data directly into R for analysis, which is particularly well-suited for collecting and storing large-scale institutional health data.

## Learning Objectives

- Read data from databases and other sources
- Import data from DHIS2 and SORMAS via their API using the `readepi` package

## Tutorial

Start by installing the `readepi` package:

```{r}
#| eval: false
install.packages("readepi")
```
