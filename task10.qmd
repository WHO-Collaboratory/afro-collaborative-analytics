title: "Task 10: Simulating disease transmission"
---

## Overview

This task covers simulating disease spread using mathematical models. You will learn how to generate disease trajectories, set up model parameters, and account for uncertainty in model simulations.

## Learning Objectives

- Load and use model structures from the epidemics package
- Load social contact matrices with socialmixr
- Generate disease spread model simulations
- Generate multiple model simulations and visualize uncertainty
