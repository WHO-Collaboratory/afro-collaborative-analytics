You’ll see the project name (sitrep) in the top-right corner of RStudio.\n\n\nStep 2: Set Up Your Folder Structure\nWithin your project, create the following subfolders to organize your files:\n\nIn RStudio, click the Files tab in the bottom-right pane.\nClick New Folder.\nCreate a folder called data/ - for storing your datasets.\nCreate another folder called outputs/ - for storing generated reports and figures."

    "text": "Setting Up Your Quarto Document\nNow let’s create a basic Quarto document that you’ll use for your epidemiological reports.\n\nStep 1: Create a New Quarto Document\n\nIn RStudio, go to File → New File → Quarto Document.\nChoose HTML as the output format.\nGive your document a title (e.g., “Epidemiological Situation Report”).\nClick Create.\nSave the document in your project folder (e.g., sitrep.qmd).\n\n\nUnderstanding Visual and Source Editing Modes\nWhen you open your Quarto document, you’ll notice two editing mode buttons in the top-left corner of the editor: Visual and Source.\n\nVisual mode: Provides a “What You See Is What You Get” editing experience, similar to a word processor. You can format text using buttons and menus, and see a preview of how your document will look.\nSource mode: Shows the raw Markdown and code syntax. You work directly with the text, code chunks, and formatting syntax (like ## for headings, **bold** for bold text, etc.).\n\nFor the rest of this tutorial and the task tutorials, we’ll assume you’re using Source mode. This allows you to directly copy and paste code chunks and content from the tutorials into your document. You can switch between modes at any time using the buttons in the top-left corner - just click Source to switch to source mode.\n\n\n\nStep 2: Set Up the YAML Header and Report Structure\nAt the top of your Quarto document, you’ll see a YAML header (the section between the --- lines). The YAML header contains metadata about your document, such as the title and output format. It tells Quarto how to render your document.\nEnsure your YAML header looks like this:\n---\ntitle: \"Epidemiological Situation Report\"\nformat: html\neditor: visual\n---\nBelow the YAML header, create a basic report structure with sections. In Quarto (and Markdown), you use ## to create section headings (level 2 headings). Each ## creates a new major section in your report. You can use ### for subsections, #### for sub-subsections, and so on.\nAdd this basic outline to your document:\n## Overview\n\nThis section will provide an introduction and overview of the situation report.\n\n## Epidemiological Trends\n\nThis section will describe epidemiological trends.\n\n## Severity\n\nThis section will conduct a severity analysis.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nThis section will summarize findings and next steps.\n\nUnderstanding Code Chunks\nA code chunk is a section in your Quarto document where you write and execute R code. Code chunks are enclosed between three backticks (```) followed by {r} and closed with three more backticks.\nTo create a code chunk:\n\nType three backticks followed by {r} on a new line: ```{r}\nPress Enter to start a new line\nWrite your R code\nType three backticks on a new line to close the chunk: ```\n\nHere’s what a code chunk looks like:\n```{r}\n# Your R code goes here\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\nYou can also insert a code chunk in RStudio by:\n\nClicking the Insert button (green plus icon with a “C”) in the toolbar, or\nUsing the keyboard shortcut: Ctrl+Alt+I (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Option+I (Mac)\n\nCode chunks allow you to run R code, create plots, generate tables, and perform data analysis. The results (outputs, plots, tables) will appear in your rendered HTML report.\n\n\n\nStep 3: Install and Load Basic Packages\nIn the first code chunk of your document, install and load the basic packages needed for report generation. We’ll use pacman, a package management tool for R that simplifies installing and loading packages. Pacman automatically installs packages if they’re not already installed, then loads them - making it much easier to manage dependencies.\n\n# Install pacman if needed\nif (!requireNamespace(\"pacman\", quietly = TRUE)) {\n  install.packages(\"pacman\")\n}\n\n# Install and load required packages using pacman\npacman::p_load(\n  tidyverse,  # For data manipulation and visualization\n  rio,        # For importing data\n  reactable   # For interactive tables\n)\n\nNote: We’ll add more packages as needed when you work through specific tasks. Additional packages will be installed as you progress through the tutorials.\n\n\nStep 4: Render Your Report\nNow let’s test that everything is working by rendering your report:\n\nClick the Render button in RStudio (or press Ctrl+Shift+K / Cmd+Shift+K).\nQuarto will process your document and generate an HTML file.\nThe HTML report will open automatically in your browser.\n\nYou should now see a basic HTML report with your title and section headings. This confirms that your Quarto setup is working correctly!\nIf you prefer, you can download the example sitrep template directly instead of creating it yourself:\nDownload solution file"
