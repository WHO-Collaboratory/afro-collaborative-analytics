    "text": "Step-by-Step Instructions: Creating a Basic Epidemiological Report in Quarto\nThis tutorial will guide you through creating a basic epidemiological report using Quarto. You’ll generate an HTML report with an incidence curve, case fatality ratio (CFR), and an interactive summary table.\n\nStep 1: Set Up Your Project Folder Structure\nBefore starting, it’s important to organize your files properly. Let’s create a clear folder structure:\n\nCreate a project folder on your computer called situation_report.\nWithin that folder, create the following subfolders:\n\ndata/ - for storing your datasets\nscripts/ - for storing R scripts (optional)\noutputs/ - for storing generated reports and figures\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Obtain the Cleaned Linelist Dataset\nFor this task, we will be using the cleaned linelist file. You have two options:\nOption 1: If you completed Task 1, you should have already cleaned the raw linelist and saved it as data/linelist.rds. You can use that file.\nOption 2: If you haven’t completed Task 1, or prefer to use the pre-cleaned version, download the cleaned linelist:\n\nNavigate to the Data page on this website.\nClick the download button for the “clean” linelist (.rds).\nSave the file to your data/ folder that you created in Step 1.\nThe file path should be: data/linelist_cleaned.rds (relative to where your Quarto document is saved).\n\nAlternatively, you can download it directly from: linelist_cleaned.rds\n\n\nStep 3: Create a New Quarto Document\n\nOpen RStudio.\nGo to File → New File → Quarto Document.\nChoose HTML as the output format.\nGive your document a title (e.g., “Epidemiological Situation Report”).\nClick Create.\nSave the document in your project folder (e.g., situation_report.qmd).\n\n\n\nStep 4: Set Up the YAML Header\nAt the top of your Quarto document, ensure your YAML header looks like this:\n---\ntitle: \"Epidemiological Situation Report\"\nformat: html\neditor: visual\n---\n\n\nStep 5: Install and Load Required Packages\nIn the first code chunk of your document, install and load the required packages:\n\n# Install pacman if needed\nif (!require(\"pacman\")) install.packages(\"pacman\")\n\n# Load required packages\npacman::p_load(\n  rio, # For importing data\n  tidyverse, # For data manipulation and visualization\n  DT, # For interactive tables\n  lubridate # For date handling\n)\n\n\n\nStep 6: Import the Data\nCreate a new code chunk to import the cleaned linelist data. The cleaned file is in RDS format, which preserves column classes:\n\n# Import the cleaned linelist data from your local data folder\n# Use the file you saved from Task 1, or the downloaded cleaned file\nlinelist &lt;- readRDS(\"data/linelist.rds\")\n\n# View the first few rows\nhead(linelist)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 7: Create an Incidence Curve\nCreate a new section in your document and add a code chunk to create an incidence curve (epidemic curve) using date_onset:\n\n# Create incidence curve\nincidence_curve &lt;- linelist |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = date_onset)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 7, fill = \"steelblue\", color = \"white\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Incidence Curve by Date of Onset\",\n    x = \"Date of Onset\",\n    y = \"Number of Cases\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 14))\n\n# Display the plot\nprint(incidence_curve)\n\n\n\n\nIncidence Curve by Date of Onset\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 8: Calculate Case Fatality Ratio (CFR)\nCreate a new section and calculate the CFR, making sure to exclude NA outcomes:\n\n# Calculate CFR (excluding NA outcomes)\ncfr_data &lt;- linelist |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(outcome)) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    total_cases = n(),\n    deaths = sum(outcome == \"Death\", na.rm = TRUE),\n    recovered = sum(outcome == \"Recover\", na.rm = TRUE),\n    cfr = round((deaths / total_cases) * 100, 2)\n  )\n\nThe estimated Case Fatality Ratio is 56.56%.\n\n\nStep 9: Create an Interactive Summary Table by Hospital\nCreate a new section and generate an interactive summary table grouped by hospital using DT::datatable():\n\n# Create summary table by hospital\n# Group NA and \"Other\" together\nhospital_summary &lt;- linelist |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    hospital_grouped = case_when(\n      is.na(hospital) | hospital %in% c(\"Missing\", \"Other\") ~ \"Other/Unknown\",\n      TRUE ~ hospital\n    )\n  ) |&gt;\n  group_by(hospital_grouped) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    total_cases = n(),\n    deaths = sum(outcome == \"Death\", na.rm = TRUE),\n    recovered = sum(outcome == \"Recover\", na.rm = TRUE),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  rename(hospital = hospital_grouped) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    cfr = round((deaths / (deaths + recovered)) * 100, 2),\n    cfr = ifelse(is.na(cfr), 0, cfr)\n  )\n\n# Create interactive table\nDT::datatable(\n  hospital_summary,\n  options = list(\n    pageLength = -1,\n    scrollX = TRUE,\n    dom = \"rt\",\n    searching = FALSE,\n    paging = FALSE,\n    info = FALSE,\n    ordering = FALSE\n  ),\n  caption = \"Summary Statistics by Hospital\",\n  colnames = c(\n    \"Hospital\" = \"hospital\",\n    \"Total Cases\" = \"total_cases\",\n    \"Deaths\" = \"deaths\",\n    \"Recovered\" = \"recovered\",\n    \"CFR (%)\" = \"cfr\"\n  )\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 10: Render Your Report\n\nClick the Render button in RStudio (or press Ctrl+Shift+K / Cmd+Shift+K).\nQuarto will process your document and generate an HTML file.\nThe HTML report will open automatically in your browser.\n\nNote: The rendered HTML file will be saved in the same folder as your Quarto document, or you can specify a different output location in your YAML header."
