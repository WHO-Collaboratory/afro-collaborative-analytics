The cleaned file is in RDS format, which preserves column classes:\n\n# Import the cleaned linelist data from your local data folder\n# Use the downloaded cleaned file\nlinelist &lt;- readRDS(\"data/linelist_cleaned.rds\")\n\n# View the first few rows\nhead(linelist)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 4: Create an Incidence Curve\nCreate a new section in your document and add a code chunk to create an incidence curve (epidemic curve) using date_onset:\n\n# Create incidence curve\nincidence_curve &lt;- linelist |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = date_onset)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 7, fill = \"steelblue\", color = \"white\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Incidence Curve by Date of Onset\",\n    x = \"Date of Onset\",\n    y = \"Number of Cases\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 14))\n\n# Display the plot\nprint(incidence_curve)\n\n\n\n\nIncidence Curve by Date of Onset\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 5: Calculate Case Fatality Ratio (CFR)\nCreate a new section and calculate the CFR, making sure to exclude NA outcomes:\n\n# Calculate CFR (excluding NA outcomes)\ncfr_data &lt;- linelist |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(outcome)) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    total_cases = n(),\n    deaths = sum(outcome == \"Death\", na.rm = TRUE),\n    recovered = sum(outcome == \"Recover\", na.rm = TRUE),\n    cfr = round((deaths / total_cases) * 100, 2)\n  )\n\nThe estimated Case Fatality Ratio is 56.56%.\n\n\nStep 6: Create an Interactive Summary Table by Hospital\nCreate a new section and generate an interactive summary table grouped by hospital using reactable():\n\n# Create summary table by hospital\n# Group NA and \"Other\" together\nhospital_summary &lt;- linelist |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    hospital_grouped = case_when(\n      is.na(hospital) | hospital %in% c(\"Missing\", \"Other\") ~ \"Other/Unknown\",\n      TRUE ~ hospital\n    )\n  ) |&gt;\n  group_by(hospital_grouped) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    total_cases = n(),\n    deaths = sum(outcome == \"Death\", na.rm = TRUE),\n    recovered = sum(outcome == \"Recover\", na.rm = TRUE),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  rename(hospital = hospital_grouped) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    cfr = round((deaths / (deaths + recovered)) * 100, 2),\n    cfr = ifelse(is.na(cfr), 0, cfr)\n  )\n\n# Create interactive table\nreactable(\n  hospital_summary,\n  columns = list(\n    hospital = colDef(name = \"Hospital\"),\n    total_cases = colDef(name = \"Total Cases\"),\n    deaths = colDef(name = \"Deaths\"),\n    recovered = colDef(name = \"Recovered\"),\n    cfr = colDef(name = \"CFR (%)\", format = colFormat(digits = 2))\n  ),\n  defaultPageSize = nrow(hospital_summary)\n)"

    "title": "Setup",
    "section": "Setting Up Your Project",
    "text": "Setting Up Your Project\nBefore you begin working on the tasks, let’s set up your RStudio project and create a basic Quarto document that you’ll use for your epidemiological reports.\n\nStep 1: Create an RStudio R Project\nAn R Project is a way to organize your work in RStudio. It helps keep all your files, data, and outputs together in one place, and automatically sets your working directory so file paths work correctly.\n\nOpen RStudio.\nGo to File → New Project.\nSelect New Directory.\nSelect New Project.\nIn the “Directory name” field, enter sitrep.\nChoose a location on your computer where you want to save the project.\nClick Create Project.\n\nRStudio will now open your new project. You’ll see the project name (sitrep) in the top-right corner of RStudio.\n\n\nStep 2: Set Up Your Project Folder Structure\nWithin your project, create the following subfolders to organize your files:\n\nIn RStudio, click the Files tab in the bottom-right pane.\nClick New Folder.\nCreate a folder called data/ - for storing your datasets.\nCreate another folder called outputs/ - for storing generated reports and figures.\n\n\n\nStep 3: Create a New Quarto Document\n\nIn RStudio, go to File → New File → Quarto Document.\nChoose HTML as the output format.\nGive your document a title (e.g., “Epidemiological Situation Report”).\nClick Create.\nSave the document in your project folder (e.g., sitrep.qmd).\n\n\nUnderstanding Visual and Source Editing Modes\nWhen you open your Quarto document, you’ll notice two editing mode buttons in the top-left corner of the editor: Visual and Source.\n\nVisual mode: Provides a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editing experience, similar to a word processor. You can format text using buttons and menus, and see a preview of how your document will look.\nSource mode: Shows the raw Markdown and code syntax. You work directly with the text, code chunks, and formatting syntax (like ## for headings, **bold** for bold text, etc.).\n\nFor the rest of this tutorial and the task tutorials, we’ll assume you’re using Source mode. This allows you to directly copy and paste code chunks and content from the tutorials into your document. You can switch between modes at any time using the buttons in the top-left corner - just click Source to switch to source mode.\n\n\n\nStep 4: Set Up the YAML Header and Report Structure\nAt the top of your Quarto document, you’ll see a YAML header (the section between the --- lines). The YAML header contains metadata about your document, such as the title and output format. It tells Quarto how to render your document.\nEnsure your YAML header looks like this:\n---\ntitle: \"Epidemiological Situation Report\"\nformat: html\neditor: visual\n---\nBelow the YAML header, create a basic report structure with sections. In Quarto (and Markdown), you use ## to create section headings (level 2 headings). Each ## creates a new major section in your report. You can use ### for subsections, #### for sub-subsections, and so on.\nAdd this basic outline to your document:\n## Executive Summary\n\nThis section will contain key findings and recommendations.\n\n## Data Overview\n\nThis section will describe the dataset and data quality.\n\n## Epidemiological Analysis\n\nThis section will contain your analytical outputs, including:\n\n- Incidence curves\n- Summary statistics\n- Key epidemiological parameters\n\n## Conclusions\n\nThis section will summarize findings and next steps.\n\nUnderstanding Code Chunks\nA code chunk is a section in your Quarto document where you write and execute R code. Code chunks are enclosed between three backticks (```) followed by {r} and closed with three more backticks.\nTo create a code chunk:\n\nType three backticks followed by {r} on a new line: ```{r}\nPress Enter to start a new line\nWrite your R code\nType three backticks on a new line to close the chunk: ```\n\nHere’s what a code chunk looks like:\n```{r}\n# Your R code goes here\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\nYou can also insert a code chunk in RStudio by: - Clicking the Insert button (green plus icon with a “C”) in the toolbar, or - Using the keyboard shortcut: Ctrl+Alt+I (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Option+I (Mac)\nCode chunks allow you to run R code, create plots, generate tables, and perform data analysis. The results (outputs, plots, tables) will appear in your rendered HTML report.\n\n\n\nStep 5: Install and Load Basic Packages\nIn the first code chunk of your document, install and load the basic packages needed for report generation. We’ll use pacman, a package management tool for R that simplifies installing and loading packages. Pacman automatically installs packages if they’re not already installed, then loads them - making it much easier to manage dependencies.\n\n# Install pacman if needed\nif (!requireNamespace(\"pacman\", quietly = TRUE)) {\n  install.packages(\"pacman\")\n}\n\n# Install and load required packages using pacman\npacman::p_load(\n  tidyverse, # For data manipulation and visualization\n  rio, # For importing data\n  reactable # For interactive tables\n)\n\nNote: We’ll add more packages as needed when you work through specific tasks. Additional packages will be installed as you progress through the tutorials.\n\n\nStep 6: Render Your Report\nNow let’s test that everything is working by rendering your report:\n\nClick the Render button in RStudio (or press Ctrl+Shift+K / Cmd+Shift+K).\nQuarto will process your document and generate an HTML file.\nThe HTML report will open automatically in your browser.\n\nNote: The rendered HTML file will be saved in the same folder as your Quarto document, or you can specify a different output location in your YAML header.\nYou should now see a basic HTML report with your title and section headings. This confirms that your Quarto setup is working correctly!\n\n\nLearning More About Quarto\nIf you’d like to learn more about Quarto, here are some helpful resources:\n\nQuarto Tutorial: Hello, Quarto: An overview of the basics, including rendering, authoring, YAML headers, code chunks, and markdown text.\nQuarto Guide: A comprehensive guide covering all aspects of Quarto, including authoring, computations, tools, documents, presentations, dashboards, websites, and more."
