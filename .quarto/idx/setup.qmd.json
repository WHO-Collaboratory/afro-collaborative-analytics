It allows you to create dynamic documents, reports, and dashboards with R, Python, and other languages.\n\n### Installation\n\nQuarto can be installed in several ways:\n\n1. **Install via RStudio**: If you're using RStudio 2022.07 or later, Quarto is included automatically. Simply install or update RStudio to get Quarto.\n\n2. **Standalone Installation**: Download and install Quarto from the [Quarto website](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/).\n\n3. **Via Package Manager**: Follow the [Quarto installation guide](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) for your operating system.\n\n### Verify Installation\n\nAfter installation, verify Quarto is working by opening a terminal/command prompt and running:\n\n```bash\nquarto --version\n```\n\nIf Quarto is installed correctly, you should see the version number displayed.\n\n### Resources for Learning Quarto\n\n- **Quarto Documentation**: Comprehensive guide at [quarto.org](https://quarto.org/)\n- **Quarto Getting Started Guide**: Step-by-step tutorial at [Quarto Getting Started](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)\n- **Quarto for R Users**: Specifically for R users at [Quarto for R](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio.html)\n- **Epidemiologist R Handbook - Reports**: Learn about creating reports with R Markdown and Quarto in the [Reports section](https://www.epirhandbook.com/en/new_pages/reports.html)\n\n## Required R Packages\n\nInstall the required R packages using the following code in your R console:\n\n```r\n# Install packages using pacman\nif (!require(\"pacman\")) install.packages(\"pacman\")\n\npacman::p_load(\n  # Add required package names here\n  # This section should be populated with the actual required packages\n)\n```\n\n### About pacman\n\nThe `pacman` package simplifies package management in R by combining the functionality of `install.packages()` and `library()` into a single function. If a package is not installed, it will install it automatically, then load it.\n\n## Getting Help with R Basics\n\nIf you're new to R or need a refresher, here are some recommended resources:\n\n- **Epidemiologist R Handbook - R Basics**: Comprehensive guide to R fundamentals for epidemiologists. Start with the [R Basics chapter](https://www.epirhandbook.com/en/new_pages/basics.html).\n\n- **AppliedEpi Tutorials**: Recommended refresher on basic R literacy: [AppliedEpi Tutorials](https://appliedepi.org/resources/tutorials.html)\n\n- **Epiverse Tutorials**: Beginner, intermediate, and advanced tutorials for epidemiological analysis with R.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nOnce you have R and RStudio installed:\n\n1.
