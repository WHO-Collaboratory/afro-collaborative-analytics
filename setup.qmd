## R and RStudio Installation

For detailed installation instructions for R and RStudio, please refer to the [Epiverse-TRACE Software Setup guide](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/tutorials-early/index.html#software-setup).

## Quarto Installation

Quarto is a scientific and technical publishing system built on Pandoc. It allows you to create dynamic documents, reports, and dashboards with R, Python, and other languages.

### Installation

Quarto can be installed in several ways:

1. **Install via RStudio**: If you're using RStudio 2022.07 or later, Quarto is included automatically. Simply install or update RStudio to get Quarto.

2. **Standalone Installation**: Download and install Quarto from the [Quarto website](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/).

3. **Via Package Manager**: Follow the [Quarto installation guide](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) for your operating system.

### Verify Installation

After installation, verify Quarto is working by opening a terminal/command prompt and running:

```bash
quarto --version
```

If Quarto is installed correctly, you should see the version number displayed.

## Required R Packages

Install the required R packages using the following code in your R console:

```r
# Install packages using pacman
if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman")

pacman::p_load(
  # Add required package names here
  # This section should be populated with the actual required packages
)
```

### About pacman

The `pacman` package simplifies package management in R by combining the functionality of `install.packages()` and `library()` into a single function. If a package is not installed, it will install it automatically, then load it.
